Project Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis of Health Insurance Dataset


Objective

To explore and analyze a health insurance dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. The goal is to visualize data insights that can inform business decisions or improve the understanding of factors influencing insurance charges.


Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

age: Age of the individual.
sex: Gender of the individual.
bmi: Body Mass Index.
children: Number of children or dependents.
smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker.
region: Geographical region of the individual.
charges: Medical insurance charges.
Steps and Analysis


Project Setup

Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Load Dataset: Load the dataset using pd.read_csv().


Data Exploration

Basic Information: Preview the dataset, check its shape, and summarize its information and statistics.
Data Cleaning: Check for and handle missing values and duplicates if necessary.


Univariate Analysis

Continuous Variables: Analyze and visualize the distribution of age, bmi, and charges using histograms.
Categorical Variables: Analyze the distribution of sex, smoker, and region using count plots.


Bivariate Analysis

Relationships: Examine the relationships between age and charges, bmi and charges, and smoker status and charges using scatter plots and box plots.
Correlation Heatmap: Visualize the correlation between numerical variables (age, bmi, children, and charges) using a heatmap.


Insights and Recommendations

Summarize Findings: Identify key patterns and insights from the analysis, such as the impact of smoking on charges or the relationship between BMI and charges.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings, such as potential strategies for managing high-risk individuals or targeted marketing.


Conclusion

Overall Summary: Summarize the overall insights and findings of the EDA.
Further Analysis: Suggest any additional analyses that could be performed to deepen understanding or address specific questions.
